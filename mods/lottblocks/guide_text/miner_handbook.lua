	"\\\nFellow brothers," ..
	"\\\nI have decided to document my years of mining experience, so that it will be of help to future miners to easily find and identity certain ores."..
	"\\\nThis handbook is the result of my few years of work and dedication. I hope you can find it to be of great use."..
	"\\\nThis first volume will contain common ores and minerals. Where to find and how to identify them."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nCoal"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nUsed as fuel to power everything from the smallest campfire to largest of dwarven forges. There's no doubt coal is the most esssential."..
	"\\\nThat is lucky too, because coal is the most common ore to be found."..
	"\\\nFound in moderate quantities anywhere below sealevel."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nLimestone"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nWhen fired, limestone become a rigid, white and shiny stone called marble."..
	"\\\nUsed to built the most magnificent and stunning cities."..
	"\\\nSeveral great cities of Gondor including the grand Minas Tirith are built with this."..
	"\\\nFound in large quantities 10 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nTin"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nA weak metal by itself. Tin is mostly used for decorative purposes."..
	"\\\nBut it still functions well enough for cheap tools and armour."..
	"\\\nTin ingots can be combined with copper ingots in a Dual Furnace to produce Bronze Alloy, a significantly stronger material for tools and armour."..
	"\\\nFound in small quantities 20 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\nFound in moderate quantities 60 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nCopper"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nMuch like tin, copper is a weak metal by itself, but slightly stronger than tin."..
	"\\\nFunctions well enough for cheap tools and armours."..
	"\\\nCopper ingots can be combined with tin ingots in a Dual Furnace to produce Bronze Alloy, a significantly stronger material for tools and armour."..
	"\\\nFound in small quantities 16 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\nFound in moderate quantities 64 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nIron"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nCan be smelted into steel."..
	"\\\nSteel is a durable and strong metal, good for decent tools and armours."..
	"\\\nFor its relative common occurrence and decent strength, it is a great material to use for normal tools, weapons and armours."..
	"\\\nFound in light quantities 2 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\nFound in small quantities 16 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\nFound in moderate quantities 64 metres below sealevel."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nOrc Iron"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nOrc Iron is normal iron that have been tainted by the constant volcanic eruptions."..
	"\\\nUsed mostly by orcs to create their weapons."..
	"\\\nThis variant of iron is much weaker than normal iron."..
	"\\\nBut smelting two of these into a Dual Furnace will form a normal steel ingot."..
	"\\\nFound in large quantities 5 metres below sealevel only in Mordor."..
	"\\\nAt 100 metres below sealevel, normal iron is located deep enough to not be tainted, so orc iron do not exists beyond that."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nSalt"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nUsed for preserving food and making food taster"..
	"\\\nCan also be eaten by itself."..
	"\\\nFound only at riverbeds, only at 5 metres below sealevel, embedded into the dirt.\"}"
