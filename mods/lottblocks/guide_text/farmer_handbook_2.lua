	"\\\nMushrooms!" ..
	"\\\nThe best thing since sliced bread!"..
	"\\\nFarming them isn't difficult but there are just a few steps to follow."..
	"\\\nAfterwhich, you will have an endless supply of mushrooms! How wonderful!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nGetting Essentials"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nFirstly you need find some tree."..
	"\\\nA base for the mushroom to grow on."..
	"\\\nOnly normal trees work, any special variant have too hard wood for the mushroom to grow on."..
	"\\\nChop down the tree and get some of the tree bark."..
	"\\\nThat will be the base of which the yummy mushrooms grow on"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nNext, you need some fertiliser for the mushroom to grow healthy."..
	"\\\nThe special ingredient is bones of the dead! Wonderful!"..
	"\\\nBones and decaying flesh will work nicely."..
	"\\\nBut if you can't locate that you can grind up the remains of an old gravestone too."..
	"\\\nAnd put it into a glass container to store it."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nThe following craft recipe should help"..
	"\\\nGL = Glass / GR = Gravestone / NT = Nothing"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nGL, NT, GL"..
	"\\\nGL, GR, GL"..
	"\\\nGL, GL, GL"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nOnce you get both of that settled, it's time to find some wild mushrooms so you can get some spores for your farm!"..
	"\\\nYou will find some easily around here at Shire and in most grasslands."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nStarting your first Mushroom Farm"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nWith the tree bark, bacteria fertiliser and spores in hand, you can start your first mushroom farm!"..
	"\\\nAh, I still remember the day I started mine."..
	"\\\nWhat a great day it was!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nAnyways."..
	"\\\nFirst find a dark area, mushroom need dark areas to grow."..
	"\\\nMake sure to not even leave any torches nearby, the light of them is enough to make the mushroom wither."..
	"\\\nNext, place the bacteria fertiliser onto the tree bark."..
	"\\\nSome white, green and orange liquid should be applied on the top of it now."..
	"\\\nNow simply place your mushroom spores above!"..
	"\\\nAnd now, just wait for them to grow!"..
	"\\\nCongrats, you have your first mushroom farm!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nNow just wait for them to grow and you will have your very-own homegrown mushrooms."..
	"\\\nI like to eat mushrooms raw, but there are much more ways to enjoy them."..
	"\\\nIf you have three of the same type of mushroom and a bowl, you can squash them into a cream of mushroom soup. Yummy!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nThis concludes all you need to know about farming mushrooms."..
	"\\\nEnjoy the fruits of your labour!\"}"
