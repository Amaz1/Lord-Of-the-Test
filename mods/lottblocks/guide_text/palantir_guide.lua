	"which a connected to the one \\\nused. But the palantir cannot simply be used. " ..
	"An object \\\nof such power as this cannot be held in place by \\\n" ..
	"normal materials, not even for an instant. Indeed, an \\\nobject of " ..
	"this power requires some of the most costly \\\nmaterials known to those alive in " ..
	"order to hold it in place.\\\n\\\nIn order to anchor itself to the world, " ..
	"the planatiri must \\\nhave, no further than two meters from it, a " ..
	"minimum of \\\n6 tilkal blocks alongside at least 16 mithril blocks. " ..
	"If, and \\\nonly if, these blocks are near the palantir, will the \\\n" ..

	"other palantiri. Then the\\\npalantir needs to be assigned a name of " ..
	"its own, so\\\nthat it can be differentiated from other palantiri. " ..
	"The\\\npalantir will not allow you to proceed if the name you try\\\n" ..
	"to give it is the same as another palantir on the\\\nnetwork, or if " ..
	"the network belongs to someone else.\\\n\\\nNext the palantir will " ..
	"allow you to chose which races\\\nmay use its network. You will be " ..
	"able to change your\\\npreferences as to which races are allowed to " ..
	"use the\\\nnetwork whenever you add a new palantir to the\\\nnetwork. " ..
	"If you want nobody except for yourself to be\\\nto be able to use " ..
	"the network, then deselect all races.\\\n\\\nAfter this, the palantir " ..
	"is ready to be used. Select\\\nanother palantir on the network to " ..
	"teleport to, and away\\\nyou go! If somebody from a race not allowed " ..
	"to use the\\\npalantir tries to use it, there will be unpleasant\\\n" ..
	"consequences for that person...!\\\n\\\nAfter adding another palantir " ..
	"to the network, to be able\\\nto teleport to it from other palantiri, " ..
	"you will need to\\\npunch any other palantiri on the network in order " ..
