	"\\\nAs the name says, gentle rolling hills filled with veins of iron. The hills here are rich in iron, even causing the waters in here to have a slight reddish-brown hue from the iron."..
	"\\\nThis large quantity of ores has of course attracted much of the dwarves and a couple of them made their home here."..
	"\\\nHidden underground and with hidden entrances, dwarven home aren't the easiest to find. But the dwarves are friendly, as long as you make clear you aren't here to cause trouble."..
